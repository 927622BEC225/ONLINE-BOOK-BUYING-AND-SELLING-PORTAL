This project is a Java-based desktop application titled "Online Book Buying and Selling Portal" that allows users to buy and sell books through a simple graphical user interface developed using AWT (Abstract Window Toolkit). Users can enter book details such as the book name, author, price, email, and phone number to list a book for sale. They can also view all the books available in the system and proceed to buy a book using a dedicated window. The application ensures that essential fields like email and phone number are filled and validates numeric inputs like price. All book data is stored persistently in a local file (books.txt), allowing the application to load previous entries upon startup. The project effectively demonstrates basic file handling, GUI component interaction, and event-driven programming in Java.
